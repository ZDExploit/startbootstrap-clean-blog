          <p>The Guide to Eavangeaea.</p>
<p>The Goal of this project is to create a gamified story that invites participants to build a city that encourages scientific growth in an effort to ultimately progress the world.
The Old Governor has laid out a plan for humanity to build a city to mitigate their destruction and the collapse of the Earth. Mark was the first to receive The Old Governor’s Plan. He said, Mark go out and find the Builders of Eavangaea.
Build a city for 160, 000, 000 to stand tall. Let them have the strength to take down civilization and construct a new from the old. Let man tear down their old homes and their stores. Brick by brick, beam by beam. Let’s use them to build new towers on the promised land deemed by the Old Governor for he made us with hands to work, sweat and bleed.
160, 000, 000 men picked up their tools. Let us be the Builders! We will build a city. Let it be called Eavangaea.</p> 
            <p>Let Eavangaea be the city of peace and democracy. Let it be the nexus of technology and science.</p> 
            <p>Let it preserve nature until its inevitable end.</p>
<p>Let them build the Sentralia. Let the Sentralia serve as the first home to Builders.</p> 
            <p>Let it be the model for the young to be educated and fight the enemy for whatever that may be. </p>
             <p> Let our electric chariots dash on the spindle, may it connect to the towers to the city and the city to the world. </p>
             <p> Let our gardens sit on our window sills and columns and our floors.</p> 
              <p>Let our water flow through their homes from the great cisterns.</p>
<p>Let them build their Megalopolis. Let them live in this city of 40 towers. </p>
            <p>Lets build the Wimbledon so we can collect and move the suns rays in our favor. </p>
           <p> Let the tunnels and the rails connect to every tower and ever region abandoned by us.</p>
<p>Let the Builders who defend the Builders be the Sleepless. For they shall not sleep until the city is built.</p>

<p>When the last Stone has been lain. When every Builder has a home in Eavangaea. Let them be called Governor. Let them be thinkers and builders. They shall build towers in the likeness of Sentralia. Let them govern the land and care for the garden around them for it is all they have.</p>
<p>Let them choose twelve men to be Entrociter. Let them guide the Governors to freedom and progression. Let the Entrociter listen to Every Governor and every Builder. Let the Governors share their food, and their resources, and their water, and their tools.</p>
</p> Mark’s Intervention</p>
</p>Mark said to the universe, Oh Governor show me a sign. Show me a miracle that my path is of you lord and not of the grim and malace.</p>
</p>And Governor spoke unto him, I am all knowing, all seeing of what is to come and what has come to past.</p>
         <p> I know of the births of the generations before you and after. </p>
          <p>Your mother is a testament of your miraculous birth. Ask her where you were born. Mark you were born with the gift to see. </p>
          <p>You can see what has come to past and what will come. What have you done with this gift?</p>
<p>Oh Governor I have selfishly devoured the mana that you provided me, when I should have shared. </p>
          <p>I have seen the angels that appear as mad dogs with fur pale as dove feathers and roar like a trumpet.</p> 
         <p> They strike fear in the hearts of all and strike down sinners who curse Your name. </p>
          <p>The angels fling buildings on men like rocks from mountain tops upon them as they refuse to repent. </p>
          <p>They marched, each stomp rattling the Earth, their trumpeted voices deafening man.</p> 
         <p> And yet you could still hear them say, The Governor Almighty is Old and loves all, repent and ye shall be saved.</p> 
         <p> Man’s dominion over the Earth has indeed ended for they failed to care for it. </p>
          <p>Those angels are the reason to build the Sentralia for they can not destroy the Builders that turned their allegiance to the Old Governor. This will be done.</p> 
          <p>I have seen the future with lush green pastures and spires built by man in Your immaculate design.</p>
</p>But I have come to see that those angels are impostors and made in your image. </p>
         <p> For man fear god’s face, they know not of the mad dogs teeth! They come from below and you most high. You have a crown and they a dome. You have a pair of wings and they’ve lost theirs.</p> 
         <p> They dance in pairs and swing and knock down all that man engineers; their towers, bridges and statues! </p>
         <p> They shall use Their new land to fight and eat and birth new dogs. </p>
         <p> Man’s domain over the earth will end after the Sentralia is built.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
